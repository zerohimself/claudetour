# ClauDEtour üö¶

A smart bash interceptor for Claude that fixes common path confusion and command issues automatically.

## What is ClauDEtour?

ClauDEtour intercepts bash commands from Claude CLI and:
- üîß Auto-corrects Windows‚ÜíLinux path confusion
- üéØ Fixes common command mistakes (like `o3-pro` ‚Üí proper path)
- üëÄ Shows corrections in a clean GUI for approval
- üìù Logs all decisions for pattern learning
- üõ°Ô∏è Only activates for Claude (your system stays normal)

## The Problem

Claude often gets confused about paths when you're using WSL:
- Tries to use Windows paths (`/mnt/c/Users/...`) when Linux paths work better
- Forgets command locations and syntax
- Makes other predictable mistakes

## The Solution

ClauDEtour acts as your login shell but ONLY intervenes when Claude is calling bash. All other tools and terminals work normally.

## Features

- **Smart Detection**: Only activates when parent process is Claude
- **Visual Approval**: Clean Tkinter GUI shows original vs corrected command
- **Inline Editing**: Edit commands on the fly before execution
- **Feedback System**: Add notes to any decision (accepted or rejected)
- **Auto-Approve Timer**: Configurable timeout for hands-free operation
- **JSON Logging**: Complete audit trail for future ML training

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claudetour.git
cd claudetour
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x bin/bash
```

3. Set as your login shell:
```bash
# Add to /etc/shells
echo "$HOME/ml_research/claudetour_project/bin/bash" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

# Set as your shell
chsh -s $HOME/ml_research/claudetour_project/bin/bash
```

4. Create symlink for safety:
```bash
ln -s $HOME/ml_research/claudetour_project/bin/bash $HOME/bash-fixer
```

5. Log out and back in to activate

## Configuration

Edit these settings in `bin/bash`:

```python
AUTO_APPROVE_SEC = 8  # Seconds before auto-approval (0 = manual only)
LOG_PATH = "~/.claude_tour/log.jsonl"
REAL_BASH = "/usr/bin/bash"
GUI_ENABLED = True  # Set False for CLI-only mode
```

### Adding Fix Rules

Add your own patterns to `FIX_RULES`:

```python
FIX_RULES = [
    (r"pattern_to_match", r"replacement", "Description for logs"),
    # Add your rules here
]
```

### Safe Passthrough Commands

Commands matching these patterns skip intervention:

```python
SAFE_PASSTHRU = [
    r"^\s*ls(\s|$)", r"^\s*pwd(\s|$)", r"^\s*echo(\s|$)",
    # Add more safe patterns
]
```

## Usage

Just use Claude normally! When ClauDEtour detects a correction opportunity:

1. **GUI Mode**: A window appears showing:
   - Original command (read-only)
   - Editable corrected command
   - Optional feedback field
   - OK/Cancel buttons

2. **CLI Mode**: Text prompt in terminal

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Enter` - Accept correction
   - `Escape` - Cancel/reject
   - `Tab` - Move between fields

### Enhanced Session Logging

For complete session capture with transcript correlation, use the claude-wrapper:

```bash
# Instead of running claude directly:
claude

# Use the wrapper for full logging:
/path/to/claudetour/claude-wrapper.sh
```

This captures:
- Full terminal transcript with timestamps
- All interceptor decisions and corrections
- Execution results and timing
- Unified session correlation

Analyze sessions with:
```bash
# Analyze the latest session with full correlation
./analyze-unified.py

# Analyze a specific session
./analyze-unified.py 12345_67890

# Basic analysis (interceptor logs only)
./analyze-session.py latest
```

Session logs are stored in:
- `~/.claude_tour/sessions/` - Individual session files
- `~/.claude_tour/log.jsonl` - Main log with all events

## Examples

### Path Correction
```bash
# Claude tries:
cd /mnt/c/Users/yourname/Documents/project

# ClauDEtour suggests:
cd /home/yourname/project
```

### Command Fix
```bash
# Claude tries:
o3-pro "What is consciousness?"

# ClauDEtour suggests:
cd /home/yourname/ml_research && ./ask_tools/ask o3_pro "What is consciousness?"
```

## How It Works

1. Claude calls bash with your command
2. ClauDEtour checks if parent process is Claude
3. If not Claude ‚Üí passes through to real bash
4. If Claude ‚Üí checks against fix rules
5. Shows GUI for approval/editing
6. Logs decision with any feedback
7. Executes final command

## Logs

All interactions are logged to `~/.claude_tour/log.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-06-27T17:43:44.274761Z",
  "orig": "o3-pro \"test\"",
  "corr": "cd /home/user/ml_research && ./ask_tools/ask o3_pro \"test\"",
  "mode": "accepted",
  "fixes": ["o3-pro command correction"],
  "feedback": "Works great!"
}
```

## Security

- Only intercepts commands from Claude
- Never modifies commands from other sources
- All corrections shown before execution
- Complete audit trail in logs
