## Pattern Learning & Auto-Correction
- [ ] Implement chat log correlation with correction logs
- [ ] Build pattern analysis tools
- [ ] Create ML training pipeline from logs
- [ ] Auto-accepter system based on confidence scores

## Smart Path Resolution

- [ ] Directory existence validation before execution
- [ ] Smart path canonicalization (Windows â†’ Linux)
- [ ] Handle relative vs absolute path confusion

## Per-Tool Customization
- [ ] Create tool-specific correction modules

- [ ] Git command improvements
- [ ] Python/pip environment detection

## UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Auto-suggestion with confidence levels
- [ ] Separate "edit suggestion" mode
- [ ] Quick-fix buttons for common corrections
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Better feedback mechanism (not just text field)

## Analysis Tools
- [ ] Log analyzer script to find patterns
- [ ] Visualization of correction frequencies
- [ ] Success/failure rate tracking
- [ ] Time saved calculator

## Integration
- [ ] Claude chat log integration
- [ ] Export corrections as shareable rules
- [ ] Community rule sharing mechanism
- [ ] Integration with other AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Performance optimization for large commands
- [ ] Async GUI to prevent blocking

## Documentation
